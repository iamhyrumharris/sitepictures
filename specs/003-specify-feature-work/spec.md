# Feature Specification: Work Site Photo Capture Page

**Feature Branch**: `003-specify-feature-work`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Work Site Photo Capture Page - Allow users at a job site to document equipment or project progress with photos directly in the app. They should be able to quickly capture, review, and manage multiple photos before saving or proceeding to the next step."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: actors (field technicians), actions (capture, review, delete, save photos), data (photos, metadata), constraints (outdoor usability, performance, permissions)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens to photos after "Quick Save"? Are they uploaded to a server or just saved locally?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific metadata fields are available on the details screen?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the maximum number of photos allowed per session?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What file format and quality should photos be saved in?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flows clearly defined for capture, review, and save operations
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and derived from user stories
6. Identify Key Entities (photos, photo sessions)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - see clarification markers"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: What happens to photos after the user selects "Quick Save"? ‚Üí A: Placeholder button for now (implementation deferred)
- Q: What metadata fields should be available on the details screen (accessed via "Next")? ‚Üí A: Details screen implementation deferred
- Q: What is the maximum number of photos allowed per session? ‚Üí A: 20 photos maximum
- Q: What photo file format and quality settings should be used? ‚Üí A: JPEG with medium quality (balanced size/quality)
- Q: What should happen when the app is backgrounded (e.g., incoming call) during a photo capture session? ‚Üí A: Preserve session - keep all captured photos and resume when returning

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A field technician arrives at a work site and needs to document the current state of equipment or project progress. They open the photo capture page in the app, which displays a live camera preview. They take multiple photos of different angles and equipment, review the thumbnails to ensure quality, delete any unwanted shots, and then choose to either add detailed notes/metadata or quickly save the photos for later processing. The entire process should be fast and efficient, minimizing time away from their primary work tasks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user opens the camera page with camera permissions granted, **When** the page loads, **Then** a full-screen live camera preview is displayed with Cancel/Back button (top-left), Done button (top-right), and capture button (bottom-center)

2. **Given** the user is on the camera page, **When** they tap the capture button, **Then** a photo is taken and a thumbnail appears in the horizontal scrollable row above the capture button

3. **Given** the user has captured 5 photos, **When** they tap the 'X' on any thumbnail, **Then** that photo is immediately removed from the session and the thumbnail disappears

4. **Given** the user has captured at least one photo, **When** they tap the Done button, **Then** a modal popup appears with "Next" and "Quick Save" options

5. **Given** the modal popup is displayed, **When** the user selects "Next", **Then** they are navigated to a details screen where they can add notes, tags, or metadata for the photos

6. **Given** the modal popup is displayed, **When** the user selects "Quick Save", **Then** the photos are saved/uploaded without requiring additional input

7. **Given** the user has captured at least one photo, **When** they tap the Cancel/Back button, **Then** a confirmation dialog appears warning about potential loss of photos

8. **Given** the confirmation dialog is displayed, **When** the user confirms cancellation, **Then** all captured photos are discarded and the user exits the camera page

9. **Given** the user has captured 15 photos, **When** they scroll the thumbnail row, **Then** thumbnails scroll horizontally smoothly without lag

10. **Given** the user opens the camera page without camera permissions, **When** the page attempts to load, **Then** a clear message is displayed explaining the permission requirement and how to enable it

11. **Given** the user has not captured any photos, **When** they tap the Cancel/Back button, **Then** they exit the camera page without any confirmation dialog

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the device runs out of storage space during a photo session? (Answer: Display error message "Storage full - cannot capture photo", disable capture button until space available)
- How does the system handle camera hardware failures or interruptions (e.g., incoming phone call)?
- What happens if the user backgrounds the app during a photo session? (Answer: session preserved, photos retained and restored on return)
- How are photos managed if the app crashes before saving?
- What happens when the user has captured 20 photos (the maximum)? (Answer: capture button disabled, clear message displayed)
- How does the UI adapt to different screen sizes and orientations?
- What happens if the temporary storage location becomes unavailable?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Photo**: Represents a single captured image in a session. Attributes include capture timestamp, file reference to temporary storage location, display order in session, and associated metadata (to be defined after clarification).
- **PhotoSession**: Represents a collection of photos captured in a single camera page session. Attributes include session start time, list of photos in capture order, session status (in-progress, completed, cancelled), and optional metadata like site location or equipment identifier.
