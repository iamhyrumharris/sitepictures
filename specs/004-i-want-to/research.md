# Research: Equipment Page Photo Management with Folders

**Feature**: 004-i-want-to
**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Complete

## Overview

This document captures research findings for implementing folder-based photo organization on the equipment detail page. The feature requires offline-first functionality, performance-optimized UI patterns, and constitutional compliance with field-first architecture principles.

## Research Areas

### 1. Flutter TabBar State Preservation

**Question**: How to maintain tab content state when switching between All Photos and Folders tabs?

**Findings**:

Flutter provides three primary approaches for preserving tab state:

1. **AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin**
   - Prevents tab widget disposal when switching away
   - Minimal memory overhead
   - Works seamlessly with TabBarView
   - Requires `wantKeepAlive = true` override

2. **PageStorageKey**
   - Preserves scroll position only
   - Does not maintain full widget state
   - Insufficient for our needs (photos would reload)

3. **IndexedStack**
   - Keeps all tabs in memory simultaneously
   - Higher memory cost (~2x for 2 tabs)
   - Instant tab switching (no rebuild)

**Decision**: **AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin**

**Rationale**:
- Meets FR-002 (switch tabs without losing state)
- Performance target: < 300ms tab switching (prevents reload)
- Memory efficient (important for battery life - Article VI)
- Standard Flutter pattern for TabBarView

**Implementation Example**:
```dart
class AllPhotosTab extends StatefulWidget {
  // ...
}

class _AllPhotosTabState extends State<AllPhotosTab>
    with AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin {

  @override
  bool get wantKeepAlive => true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    super.build(context); // Required for mixin
    // ... build photo grid
  }
}
```

- Flutter docs: `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin`
- Flutter TabBarView source code (uses PageStorageKey by default, mixin overrides)

### 2. SQLite Junction Table Patterns for Folder-Photo Associations

**Question**: How to model many-to-many relationship between folders and photos with before/after metadata?

**Findings**:

Three schema patterns evaluated:

1. **Junction Table with Metadata** (chosen)
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE folder_photos (
     folder_id TEXT NOT NULL,
     photo_id TEXT NOT NULL,
     before_after TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(before_after IN ('before', 'after')),
     added_at TEXT NOT NULL,
     PRIMARY KEY (folder_id, photo_id),
     FOREIGN KEY (folder_id) REFERENCES photo_folders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     FOREIGN KEY (photo_id) REFERENCES photos(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
   );
   ```
   - Pros: Normalized, referential integrity, efficient queries
   - Cons: JOIN required for photo+folder queries

2. **Separate Before/After Tables**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE before_photos (...);
   CREATE TABLE after_photos (...);
   ```
   - Pros: No metadata field needed
   - Cons: Violates normalization (DRY), duplicated logic, schema bloat

3. **Embedded JSON Arrays in Folders**
   ```sql
   photo_folders.before_photo_ids TEXT (JSON array)
   photo_folders.after_photo_ids TEXT (JSON array)
   ```
   - Pros: Single table query
   - Cons: No referential integrity, inefficient queries (full table scan), update complexity

**Decision**: **Junction Table with Metadata (Option 1)**

**Rationale**:
- Photos can exist standalone OR in folder (not both simultaneously for this MVP)
- `before_after` is a property of the folder-photo relationship, not the photo itself
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` maintains Article III data integrity
- Indexed queries: `CREATE INDEX idx_folder_photos_folder ON folder_photos(folder_id)`
- Standard SQL pattern (maintainable, predictable)

**Query Patterns**:
```sql
-- Get all photos for folder's "before" section
SELECT p.* FROM photos p
JOIN folder_photos fp ON p.id = fp.photo_id
WHERE fp.folder_id = ? AND fp.before_after = 'before'
ORDER BY p.timestamp DESC;

-- Get all photos with optional folder info (All Photos tab)
SELECT p.*, fp.folder_id, pf.name AS folder_name
FROM photos p
LEFT JOIN folder_photos fp ON p.id = fp.photo_id
LEFT JOIN photo_folders pf ON fp.folder_id = pf.id
WHERE p.equipment_id = ?
ORDER BY p.timestamp DESC;
```

**Performance**:
- Index on `folder_id` + `photo_id` ensures < 10ms query time
- LEFT JOIN for All Photos tab adds ~5ms overhead (acceptable)

### 3. Material Design Visual Indicators for Folder Membership

**Question**: How to indicate folder membership on All Photos tab without cluttering UI?

**Findings**:

Four visual indicator patterns from Material Design and iOS/Android conventions:

1. **Icon Badge (top-right corner)** (chosen)
   - Small folder icon (16x16) overlaid on photo thumbnail
   - Common pattern: iOS Photos app, Google Drive
   - Non-intrusive, immediately recognizable

2. **Border Color Coding**
   - Blue border for folder photos, no border for standalone
   - Ambiguous meaning (could indicate selection, sync status, etc.)
   - Not universally understood

3. **Text Label Overlay**
   - Folder name text on thumbnail
   - Clutters UI, reduces photo visibility
   - Poor readability on small thumbnails

4. **Separate Section Dividers**
   - "Folder Photos" / "Standalone Photos" headers
   - Breaks chronological ordering (violates FR-004)
   - Requires scrolling/cognitive load

**Decision**: **Icon Badge (Option 1)**

**Rationale**:
- Article VII: Intuitive Simplicity - universally understood icon
- Preserves chronological ordering (FR-004)
- Minimal visual noise (field workers focus on photos, not organization)
- Common iOS/Android pattern (familiar to users)

**Implementation Details**:
```dart
Stack(
  children: [
    PhotoThumbnail(...),
    if (photo.folderId != null)
      Positioned(
        top: 4,
        right: 4,
        child: Container(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(2),
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            color: Colors.black54,
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(4),
          ),
          child: Icon(Icons.folder, size: 14, color: Colors.white),
        ),
      ),
  ],
)
```

**Accessibility**: Badge includes semantic label "In folder: {folderName}" for screen readers

### 4. Offline-First Folder Deletion with Photo Orphaning

**Question**: How to handle folder deletion when photos exist, respecting offline-first and data integrity principles?

**Findings**:

Three deletion strategies evaluated:

1. **User Choice Dialog** (chosen)
   - Present dialog: "Delete all photos" OR "Keep photos as standalone"
   - Immediate local execution
   - Queue sync item for server reconciliation
   - Pros: User control (Article III), clear intent, prevents accidental loss
   - Cons: Extra step (minor friction)

2. **Soft Delete**
   - Mark `is_deleted = 1`, hide from UI
   - Sync deletes to server, hard delete locally after confirmation
   - Pros: Reversible
   - Cons: Complicates queries (`WHERE is_deleted = 0`), database bloat, unclear UX

3. **Automatic Cascade Delete**
   - `ON DELETE CASCADE` foreign key deletes all photos
   - Pros: Simple implementation
   - Cons: Violates Article III (accidental data loss risk), no undo

**Decision**: **User Choice Dialog (Option 1)**

**Rationale**:
- Article III: "No photo shall ever be lost due to technical failure" - user makes explicit choice
- Article II: Offline autonomy - executes immediately, no server dependency
- Article VII: Plain language choices ("Delete photos" vs "Keep as standalone")
- Sync reconciliation: Queue item captures user choice for server sync

**Implementation Flow**:
```
1. User long-presses folder → Delete option
2. Show AlertDialog with two actions:
   - "Delete Photos" → DELETE FROM folder_photos WHERE folder_id = ?, DELETE FROM photos WHERE id IN (...)
   - "Keep as Standalone" → DELETE FROM folder_photos WHERE folder_id = ?, DELETE FROM photo_folders WHERE id = ?
3. Execute in SQLite transaction (rollback on error)
4. Add sync queue item with deletePhotos boolean
5. Update UI state via FolderProvider
```

**Edge Case Handling**:
- Empty folder (no photos): Skip dialog, delete immediately
- Offline deletion: Fully local, sync when online
- Conflict resolution: Server wins if folder recreated elsewhere

### 5. Work Order Input Validation

**Question**: What validation rules for work order/job number input during folder creation?

**Findings**:

Three validation approaches:

1. **Free-Text with Basic Sanitization** (chosen)
   - Allow any alphanumeric + common symbols (-, _, #, /)
   - Strip leading/trailing whitespace
   - Max length: 50 characters (prevents UI overflow)
   - No format enforcement
   - Pros: Flexible for varied work order systems, minimal friction
   - Cons: Potential for inconsistent naming

2. **Regex Pattern Validation**
   - Enforce pattern like `^[A-Z]{2}-\d{4}$` (e.g., "WO-1234")
   - Pros: Consistent format
   - Cons: Too restrictive (field workers may have non-standard formats), increases friction (Article I)

3. **Predefined Dropdown List**
   - Fetch active work orders from API/database
   - Pros: Guaranteed valid work orders
   - Cons: Requires API/sync (violates Article II offline requirement), high latency

**Decision**: **Free-Text with Basic Sanitization (Option 1)**

**Rationale**:
- Article I: Field-first - minimize friction, trust user input
- Article II: Offline autonomy - no API dependency
- Real-world flexibility: Organizations have varied work order formats (WO-123, JOB#456, MAINT-2024-001, etc.)
- Downstream validation: Search/filter can handle varied formats

**Implementation**:
```dart
String sanitizeWorkOrder(String input) {
  return input.trim()
    .replaceAll(RegExp(r'[^\w\s\-_#/]'), '') // Remove special chars except common ones
    .substring(0, min(input.length, 50));    // Max 50 chars
}

// Folder name generation
String folderName = '${sanitizedWorkOrder} - ${DateFormat('yyyy-MM-DD').format(DateTime.now())}';
```

**User Feedback**:
- Show live character count (50 max) in dialog
- Disable "Create" button if input empty or all whitespace
- No red error messages (creates anxiety), just helpful placeholder: "Enter work order or job number"

## Decision Summary

| Area | Decision | Constitutional Alignment |
|------|----------|-------------------------|
| Tab State Preservation | AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin | Article VI (Performance) |
| Data Model | Junction table with before/after metadata | Article III (Data Integrity) |
| Folder Indicators | Icon badge (top-right) | Article VII (Intuitive Simplicity) |
| Folder Deletion | User choice dialog | Article III (Data Integrity) |
| Work Order Validation | Free-text with sanitization | Article I (Field-First), Article II (Offline) |

## Performance Impact Assessment

**Memory**:
- AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin: ~500KB per tab (2 tabs = 1MB)
- Folder metadata: ~200 bytes per folder × 15 avg = 3KB
- Junction table records: ~100 bytes per association × 50 avg = 5KB
- **Total overhead**: < 1.5MB (negligible on modern devices)

**Database**:
- Index size: ~10KB per 100 folders
- Query performance:
  - Folder list: < 5ms (indexed equipment_id + created_at DESC)
  - All Photos with folders: < 15ms (LEFT JOIN)
  - Before/After photos: < 10ms (indexed folder_id)

**UI Rendering**:
- Tab switching: < 200ms (cached content, no network)
- Photo grid: < 800ms for 100 thumbnails (existing optimization)
- Folder list: < 100ms for 20 folders (simple ListTile widgets)

**All targets meet Article VI thresholds.**

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Tab state lost on memory pressure | Low | Medium | Document state restoration in error logs, acceptable trade-off |
| Junction table JOIN performance degrades with 1000+ photos | Low | Low | Equipment limited to 100 photos (existing constraint) |
| Folder name collisions (same work order, same date) | Medium | Low | Append UUID suffix if duplicate detected |
| User confusion about folder vs standalone photos | Medium | Medium | Clear empty states, onboarding tooltip (future) |
