# Research: FieldPhoto Pro Technology Stack

## Flutter/Dart Cross-Platform Development

**Decision**: Flutter 3.x with Dart for mobile-first cross-platform development
**Rationale**:
- Single codebase for iOS/Android with desktop support
- Native performance for camera and GPS integration
- Strong offline-first capabilities with local storage
- Excellent battery optimization features
- Rich ecosystem for industrial app requirements

**Alternatives Considered**:
- React Native: Rejected due to weaker offline capabilities and performance concerns
- Native iOS/Android: Rejected due to maintenance overhead for dual codebases
- Xamarin: Rejected due to Microsoft deprecation and Flutter's superior performance

## Local Storage Strategy

**Decision**: SQLite via sqflite package for primary data storage
**Rationale**:
- Fully offline-capable with ACID transactions
- Excellent performance for hierarchical queries
- Strong indexing capabilities for fast search
- Native integration with Flutter
- Cross-platform consistency

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Hive: Rejected due to lack of complex relationship support
- Realm: Rejected due to synchronization complexity and licensing
- File-based storage: Rejected due to lack of transactional integrity

## Camera Integration

**Decision**: Flutter camera package with platform-specific optimizations
**Rationale**:
- Native camera access with full resolution support
- Built-in optimization for battery usage
- Supports metadata capture (GPS, timestamp)
- Cross-platform consistency with platform-specific features

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Image picker: Rejected due to lack of full camera control
- Platform channels: Rejected due to development complexity

## GPS and Location Services

**Decision**: geolocator package with location permissions
**Rationale**:
- Accurate GPS coordinate capture
- Battery-optimized location tracking
- Permission handling across platforms
- Offline coordinate storage capability

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Platform-specific location services: Rejected for consistency
- Google Maps integration: Rejected for offline-first requirement

## Synchronization Architecture

**Decision**: Custom REST API with background sync using http package
**Rationale**:
- Full control over conflict resolution (merge all versions)
- Optimized for large photo uploads
- Works with PostgreSQL backend for team features
- Supports incremental sync for bandwidth efficiency

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Firebase: Rejected due to vendor lock-in and self-hosting requirement
- GraphQL: Rejected due to complexity for photo upload scenarios
- WebSockets: Rejected due to battery impact and offline-first priority

## Backend Technology Stack

**Decision**: Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL for sync API
**Rationale**:
- JSON-first API design matching Dart models
- Excellent PostgreSQL integration for company data isolation
- Docker-friendly for self-hosting requirements
- Strong ecosystem for file upload handling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Python/FastAPI: Rejected for consistency with frontend JSON handling
- .NET Core: Rejected due to self-hosting complexity
- Go: Rejected due to development speed requirements

## Photo Storage Strategy

**Decision**: Local file system with SQLite metadata references
**Rationale**:
- Full resolution preservation (constitutional requirement)
- Offline-first with metadata in database
- Efficient storage management
- Cross-platform file handling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Blob storage in database: Rejected due to performance and size constraints
- Cloud-first storage: Rejected due to offline-first requirement

## Testing Framework

**Decision**: Flutter test with integration_test and mockito
**Rationale**:
- Built-in widget testing for UI components
- Integration testing for offline/online scenarios
- Mockito for service layer unit tests
- Performance testing capabilities

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Third-party testing frameworks: Rejected for framework consistency
- Manual testing only: Rejected due to complexity of offline scenarios

## Key Technical Patterns

### Offline-First Data Flow
1. All operations write to SQLite first
2. Background sync queues changes when online
3. Conflict resolution merges all versions
4. UI reflects local state immediately

### Modular Architecture
- Camera Service: Isolated photo capture and metadata extraction
- Storage Service: SQLite operations and file management
- Sync Service: Background synchronization with retry logic
- GPS Service: Location tracking and boundary detection
- Navigation Service: Hierarchical breadcrumb management

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for photo thumbnails
- Background processing for non-critical operations
- Efficient SQLite indexing for search operations
- Memory management for large photo collections
- Battery optimization through selective GPS usage

## Research Validation

All technical choices align with constitutional principles:
- **Field-First**: Flutter mobile-first design
- **Offline Autonomy**: SQLite + local files provide full offline capability
- **Data Integrity**: ACID transactions + immutable photo storage
- **Performance**: Native performance with <2s capture targets
- **Modular**: Clear service separation enables independent testing
- **Collaborative**: Device-based attribution with audit trails

No critical unknowns remain - all technology choices are proven and well-documented for industrial mobile applications.
