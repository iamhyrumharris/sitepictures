# Feature Specification: Industrial Photo Management Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-industrial`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an industrial photo management application that solves the critical problem of work photo organization for field technicians and engineers..."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Extracted key concepts: field photo organization, industrial workers, offline support, GPS organization
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Field workers (PLC programmers, technicians, engineers), Project managers, Client representatives
   → Actions: Capture photos, organize by location/client, add notes, search/retrieve, sync offline work
   → Data: Photos, GPS metadata, annotations, equipment hierarchy, revision history
   → Constraints: Offline operation, sub-30 second workflows, zero data loss
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All critical aspects specified in description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Multiple clear user flows provided (Sarah, Mike, Jennifer scenarios)
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement testable and measurable based on success metrics
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Photo, Location, Client, Equipment, Annotation, User, Team
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No major clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: When a device reaches storage capacity, what should happen to new photos that need to be captured? → A: Block capture until user manually frees space
- Q: How should field workers authenticate to access the app and their team's shared photos? → A: No authentication - device-based access only
- Q: What image quality should be used for photo capture to balance storage and documentation needs? → A: Full resolution always (highest quality, more storage)
- Q: When the same photo/equipment has conflicting updates from multiple devices, which version should take priority? → A: Merge both versions (keep all data)
- Q: How long should photos and their metadata be retained in the system? → A: Indefinitely (never auto-delete)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Industrial field workers need a dedicated photo management solution that automatically organizes technical documentation photos by client and location, works completely offline, and enables instant retrieval of equipment photos months or years after capture, replacing the chaos of mixed personal/work photos in standard camera apps.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** Sarah is at a client site with no internet connectivity, **When** she opens FieldPhoto Pro and takes photos of control panels, **Then** photos are immediately saved with GPS location and timestamp, organized under the correct client folder, and available for annotation

2. **Given** Mike needs to show equipment evolution over 5 years, **When** he navigates to a specific equipment folder, **Then** he sees all photos in chronological order with revision dates and modification notes clearly visible

3. **Given** Jennifer has been working offline at a remote site, **When** she returns to an area with connectivity, **Then** all her photos and annotations automatically sync without data loss or duplicates

4. **Given** a team of technicians is working on a large facility, **When** any team member adds photos or notes to equipment, **Then** all team members see the updates in the same organized structure with clear attribution

5. **Given** a client requests documentation from 6 months ago, **When** the user searches by date/location/client, **Then** specific photos are retrieved in under 10 seconds

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GPS signal is unavailable? → System allows manual location entry or uses last known location with user confirmation
- How does system handle storage full scenarios? → System blocks new photo capture when storage is full, requiring user to manually free space before continuing
- What happens during sync conflicts? → System automatically merges both versions, keeping all data from all devices
- How are photos handled when switching devices? → Full photo history restored from sync, maintaining all organization

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Photo Capture & Storage**
- **FR-001**: System MUST capture photos and save them in under 15 seconds from app launch
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve original photos without modification (immutable storage)
