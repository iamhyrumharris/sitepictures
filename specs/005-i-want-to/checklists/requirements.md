# Specification Quality Checklist: Context-Aware Camera and Expandable Navigation FABs

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: PASS
- Specification uses user-centric language ("field technicians," "capture photos," "save actions")
- No mentions of Flutter, Dart, widgets, providers, or other technical implementation details
- All sections describe WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Terminology is accessible to business stakeholders

### Requirement Completeness: PASS
- All 29 functional requirements are specific and testable
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (90% accuracy, 2 fewer taps, 300ms animations, 30% time savings)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not system internals
- 23 acceptance scenarios cover all user stories with Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases address permission failures, data validation, and UI edge cases
- Out of Scope section clearly bounds the feature
- 10 assumptions and 5 dependencies explicitly documented

### Feature Readiness: PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories prioritized (P1-P4) for independent implementation
- Success criteria are observable without knowing implementation (tap counts, accuracy percentages, time savings)
- No leakage of technical details (no mentions of code, classes, methods, or frameworks)

## Notes

- **Strong Points**:
  - Clear context-aware button labeling for three distinct camera launch scenarios
  - Well-defined FAB expansion patterns for different navigation hierarchy levels
  - Comprehensive edge case coverage including permission handling and data validation
  - Technology-agnostic success criteria focusing on user comprehension and UI consistency
  - Scope appropriately limited to UI changes (button labels) with mock functionality

- **Scope Clarification**:
  - **Phase 1 (This Feature)**: Display context-appropriate button labels on camera page; new buttons show placeholder functionality
  - **Phase 2 (Future)**: Implement actual save logic for equipment-specific and before/after photo workflows
  - Existing "Next" and "Quick Save" behavior from home context remains fully functional

- **Considerations for Planning**:
  - Assumption 6 & 7 note that creating subsites/equipment from client page needs parent selection UI - planner should address this workflow
  - FR-007 specifies placeholder confirmation message for new buttons - planner should define message text
  - Mock functionality should be clear to users that feature is coming (avoid confusion)

- **Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` - Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation planning
