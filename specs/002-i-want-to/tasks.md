# Tasks: UI/UX Design for Site Pictures Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-i-want-to/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, screens
   → Integration: DB, middleware, navigation
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All screens implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no shared dependencies
- MainSite and SubSite share site.dart file (T017-T018 sequential)
- Router configuration split across T050 and T052 (sequential)
- Database service extended in T024 (sequential with T023)
- Verify all tests fail before implementing features
- Each task creates complete, working code
- Follow Flutter best practices and conventions
- **CRITICAL BREADCRUMB REQUIREMENT**: Breadcrumb must display actual page titles (e.g., "ABC Corp > Warehouse A > Pump Room") NOT generic labels (e.g., "Client > Site > Equipment"). See FR-014 and FR-017 in spec.md. Tasks T032, T034, T059, T012a, T069a specifically address this requirement.
- **NEW SPEC CLARIFICATIONS**:
  - Storage full: Block capture with "Storage Full - Free up space to continue" (FR-010c, T045, T013a, T069b)
  - Photo limit: 100 per equipment, warning at 90, block at 100 with "Photo limit reached for this equipment" (FR-020, FR-021, T010, T026, T044, T045, T013b, T069c)
  - Equipment placement: Can be added to BOTH main sites AND subsites (FR-005, FR-006, T042, T043, T014a, T069d)
  - Recent locations: Service added (T029a) to support FR-001

## Phase 3.11: Remediation Tasks (Post-Analysis)
**Purpose**: Address critical gaps identified in quickstart.md validation analysis (2025-10-03)
**Source**: Analysis report comparing implemented code against quickstart.md flows

### CRITICAL Priority (Must complete before production)
- [X] T071 Fix empty state message in lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart lines 196-215 to exactly match "Add Your First Client" per spec FR-001 and quickstart.md Scenario 1 (currently shows "No clients yet / Add your first client to get started")
- [X] T072 Create missing integration_test/role_access_test.dart to validate FR-018 role-based access for all three roles: admin (full access), technician (create/edit/view), viewer (read-only) per quickstart.md Scenario 7
- [X] T073 [P] Create test/performance/photo_capture_performance_test.dart to validate <2s photo capture requirement (Constitution Article VI, quickstart.md Scenario 10)
- [X] T074 [P] Create test/performance/navigation_performance_test.dart to validate <500ms screen transitions (Constitution Article VI, quickstart.md Scenario 10)
- [X] T075 [P] Create test/performance/search_performance_test.dart to validate <1s search results (Constitution Article VI, quickstart.md Scenario 10)
- [X] T076 [P] Create test/performance/battery_usage_test.dart to validate <5% drain per hour active use (Constitution Article VI, quickstart.md Scenario 10)

### HIGH Priority (Should complete for full spec compliance)
- [X] T077 Add "Quick Save" button to lib/screens/camera/carousel_view.dart per FR-009 to save current photo individually (currently only has delete button)
- [X] T078 Add "Next" button to lib/screens/camera/carousel_view.dart per FR-010 to advance to next photo programmatically (in addition to swipe gesture)
- [X] T079 Implement _navigateToLocation() method in lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart line 250 using RecentLocationsService to enable FR-001 recent location navigation (currently TODO)
- [X] T080 Create integration_test/search_functionality_test.dart to validate FR-012 search scenarios from quickstart.md Scenario 8 (search by equipment name, client name, result navigation)
- [X] T081 Create integration_test/ui_consistency_test.dart to validate FR-011, FR-012, FR-013 (blue header #4A90E2 on all screens, "Ziatech" app name visible, bottom nav accessible) from quickstart.md Scenario 9
- [X] T082 [P] Create missing integration_test/storage_full_test.dart per tasks.md T013a to validate FR-010c storage full error handling with exact message "Storage Full - Free up space to continue"
- [X] T083 [P] Create missing integration_test/photo_limit_test.dart per tasks.md T013b to validate FR-020, FR-021 (100 photo limit per equipment, warning at 90, blocking at 100)
- [X] T084 [P] Create missing integration_test/equipment_placement_test.dart per tasks.md T014a to validate FR-005, FR-006 (equipment can be added to BOTH main sites AND subsites)

### MEDIUM Priority (Quality improvements)
- [ ] T085 Add persistent sync queue indicator UI element in lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart or update quickstart.md line 99 to clarify SnackBar notification is sufficient (currently shows badge icon when pending > 0)
- [ ] T086 Document carousel control clarification in specs/002-i-want-to/research.md: whether Quick Save/Next are carousel controls or camera controls (resolve spec ambiguity between FR-008, FR-009, FR-010)

## Dependencies (Phase 3.11)
- T071 can run immediately (simple text fix in home screen)
- T072-T076 are independent test creation tasks and can run in parallel [P]
- T077-T078 both modify lib/screens/camera/carousel_view.dart (run sequentially)
- T079 depends on T029a (recent locations service) which is already complete ✅
- T080-T084 are independent test creation tasks that can run in parallel [P]
- T085 is UI enhancement or documentation task
- T086 is documentation clarification task

**Recommendation**: Complete 6 CRITICAL tasks (T071-T076) and 8 HIGH priority tasks (T077-T084) before considering implementation complete per quickstart.md validation.

**Remediation Task Count**: 16 new tasks (6 CRITICAL, 8 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM)
