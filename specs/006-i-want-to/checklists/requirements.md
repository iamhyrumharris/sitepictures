# Specification Quality Checklist: Camera Photo Save Functionality

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Key Metrics**:
- 3 prioritized user stories with 17 total acceptance scenarios
- 60 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-060) organized into 8 logical groups
- 11 measurable success criteria
- 9 edge cases identified with resolution strategies
- 10 documented assumptions
- 7 identified dependencies
- 15 out-of-scope items clearly defined

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage of all three camera contexts (home, equipment, folder)
- Clear separation between Quick Save and Next button workflows
- Well-defined "Needs Assigned" folder structure (global and per-client)
- Technology-agnostic success criteria focused on user outcomes
- Edge cases include error handling and conflict resolution

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` - No clarifications needed, specification is complete and unambiguous

## Notes

All quality checks passed. Specification is ready for implementation planning phase.
